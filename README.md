# N64 Arduino Controller

Main controller for [Bucket-Bot](https://github.com/RobbyChapman/bucket-bot)

![Alt text](./assets/Controller2.jpeg?raw=true "Optional Title")

The goal was to wrap [N64-To-USB](https://github.com/MickMad/N64-To-USB) into an Arduino compatible library. This was 
done to free up an existing sketch I am working on which utilizes Xbee radios to communicate with 
[bucket-Bot](https://github.com/RobbyChapman/bucket-bot)
